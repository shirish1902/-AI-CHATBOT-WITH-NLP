DESCRIPTION:-

The AI Chatbot with NLP is an interactive system designed to understand and respond to user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This chatbot is built using Python and leverages NLP libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and SpaCy for efficient text processing and comprehension.


The chatbot utilizes tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER) to analyze user input. It employs a pre-trained language model for text classification and intent recognition, ensuring accurate responses. The chatbot follows a rule-based and machine-learning-based approach, enhancing its adaptability to different queries.


We have used NLTK for text preprocessing, including stopword removal, stemming, and sentence segmentation, while SpaCy helps with dependency parsing and named entity recognition. The chatbot is designed with a conversational flow, where responses are retrieved from a predefined knowledge base or generated dynamically. It also integrates a simple dialogue management system to maintain context during conversations.


The deliverable includes a Python script implementing the chatbot and a working prototype that interacts with users, providing meaningful responses. This project demonstrates the effective use of NLP techniques in developing intelligent conversational agents, making it ideal for applications in customer support, education, and automated assistance.
